# coding-quiz
When a user clicks the "start quiz" button, they will be presented with an array of multiple choice questions and a timer will begin counting down from 75 seconds. The application will keep track of user's right or wrong answers and will deduct time if the wrong answer is chosen. Once the quiz has ended, the user will be shown their score and given a chance to save it under a chosen name to the highscores list.
